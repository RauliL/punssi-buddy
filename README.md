# Punssi-Buddy

Punssi-Buddy is a handy desktop assistant that reminds you when it's time to
get beer. It sits silently on your desktop, until it's 4 p.m. on Friday when it
announces that it's time to stop working and go get some beer instead. It also
reminds you half an hour and fifteen minutes before 4 p.m. making audible
announcements.

## Installation

Installation is quite simple. Just run:

```bash
$ npm install -g punssi-buddy
```

After that, you can run the command `punssi-buddy` to start the application.
